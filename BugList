The following were listed as bugs in the program.

1. Card Page says "undefined by undefined" in the header.
2. Doesn't appear that any cards are displaying on the user pages.
3. No way that I can tell how/if cards were exchanged.
4. No error message from invalid card when entered when trying to barter.
5. *FIXED* Can enter invalid email address.
    Solution: Use HTML5 email address in form.
6. Have no way to get the ID of the card you are offering to barter so you can't currently barter.
7. Pictures aren't resized
8. *FIXED* Submitting form with password but no username causes a 400 error.
    Solution: Added html5 form input required.
9. *FIXED* User list shows all User IDs - no way of knowing which one I am.
    Solution: Added Name of the User along with ID.
